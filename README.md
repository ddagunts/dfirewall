# dfirewall

dns firewall, or dynamic firewall.

`this is experimental`

The intent of this software is to assist in implementing a "default deny" egress network policy at the edge with minimal impact to legitimate clients.

This is a DNS proxy intended to be placed in front of your DNS resolvers/forwarders (Pi-hole, etc).  It allows to keep track of network activity by monitoring DNS requests and responses ( IP addresses and TTLs ) through reliance on Redis and execution of scripts.
It allows to create an IP firewall with the following features:
 - Block outgoing connections by default
 - Force clients to perform their DNS lookups through our server (or stay blocked)
 - Allow clients outbound access to IPs resolved, with timed expiration of rules
 - Turns any DNS block into a firewall block

# Configuration

dfirewall is configured through environment variables and JSON configuration files for advanced features.

**ðŸ“– For comprehensive configuration guidance, see:** [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)

### Quick Start Configuration
```bash
# Required
UPSTREAM=1.1.1.1:53          # upstream DNS resolver
REDIS=redis://127.0.0.1:6379 # Redis connection string

# Optional
PORT=53                      # listening port
WEB_UI_PORT=8080            # web interface port
DEBUG=true                  # enable verbose logging
```
# Setup on Linux

dfirewall can be deployed as a network router with firewall capabilities.  The easiest platform to do this on is Linux thanks to ipset.

**ðŸ“– For a quick-start demo setup on Linux see:** [docs/linux-setup.md](docs/linux-setup.md)

## Redis Key Expiration Monitoring (for non-Linux/non-ipset support)

If you're running dfirewall on non-Linux platforms or want to use custom firewall management, you can enable Redis key expiration monitoring:

```bash
# Set the EXPIRE_SCRIPT environment variable
EXPIRE_SCRIPT=/path/to/your/expire_script.sh

# Example using the provided generic expire script
EXPIRE_SCRIPT=./scripts/expire_generic.sh
```

When enabled, dfirewall will:
1. Monitor Redis keyspace notifications for expired keys
2. Execute your expire script when DNS TTLs expire
3. Pass the same environment variables as INVOKE_SCRIPT, plus `ACTION=EXPIRE`

**Redis Configuration Note**: Redis keyspace notifications must be enabled. dfirewall attempts to enable this automatically, but if it fails, run:
```bash
redis-cli CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events Ex
```

## Redis Security Configuration

dfirewall supports secure Redis connections with TLS encryption and authentication. Configure basic authentication or advanced TLS encryption with client certificates.

**ðŸ“– For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/redis-security.md](docs/redis-security.md)

## Web UI for Rule Management

dfirewall includes a built-in web interface for viewing and managing firewall rules. Enable it by setting the `WEB_UI_PORT` environment variable:

```bash
# Enable web UI on port 8080
WEB_UI_PORT=8080
```

Once enabled, access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` (or your server's IP). The web UI provides:

- **Real-time Statistics**: View total rules, active clients, unique domains, and IPs
- **Rule Listing**: See all active firewall rules with TTL and expiration times
- **Rule Management**: Delete individual rules manually
- **Blacklist Management**: Add/remove IPs and domains from blacklists
- **Reputation Checking**: Check IP/domain reputation with threat intelligence providers
- **AI Analysis**: Analyze domains and IPs for threats using AI providers
- **Auto-refresh**: Interface updates every 30 seconds automatically

### Web UI Authentication and Security
The Web UI supports HTTPS encryption, password authentication, LDAP integration, and header-based authentication for reverse proxy setups.

**ðŸ“– For detailed authentication setup, see:** [docs/webui-authentication.md](docs/webui-authentication.md)

## Per-Client Script Configuration

dfirewall supports per-client script configuration for different firewall policies based on client identity using CIDR, IP, and regex pattern matching.

**ðŸ“– For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/per-client-scripts.md](docs/per-client-scripts.md)

## IP and Domain Blacklisting

dfirewall supports comprehensive IP and domain blacklisting using Redis and file-based approaches with pattern matching and Web UI management.

**ðŸ“– For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/blacklist-configuration.md](docs/blacklist-configuration.md)

## IP and Domain Reputation Checking

dfirewall integrates with VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLVoid, and custom threat intelligence providers for real-time security analysis.

**ðŸ“– For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/reputation-checking.md](docs/reputation-checking.md)

## AI-Powered Threat Detection

dfirewall integrates AI technology (OpenAI, Claude, local models) for domain analysis, traffic anomaly detection, and proactive threat hunting.

**ðŸ“– For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/ai-threat-detection.md](docs/ai-threat-detection.md)

## Log Monitoring (over SSH)

dfirewall can SSH to remote servers and monitor log files in real-time, extracting IP addresses and domains using configurable regex patterns. This extends detection beyond DNS to include web server logs, firewall logs, application logs, and more.

**Features:**
- SSH connection management with password, key, and agent authentication
- Real-time log tailing with rotation handling  
- Configurable regex patterns for IP/domain extraction
- Integration with existing Redis storage and firewall scripts
- Support for multiple servers and log files
- Resilient connections with automatic reconnection
