# dfirewall

dns firewall, or dynamic firewall.

`this is experimental`

The intent of this software is to assist in implementing a "default deny" egress network policy at the edge with minimal impact to legitimate clients.

This is a DNS proxy intended to be placed in front of your DNS resolvers/forwarders (Pi-hole, etc).  It allows to keep track of network activity by monitoring DNS requests and responses ( IP addresses and TTLs ) through reliance on Redis and execution of scripts.
It allows to create an IP firewall with the following features:
 - Block outgoing connections by default
 - Force clients to perform their DNS lookups through our server (or stay blocked)
 - Allow clients outbound access to IPs resolved, with timed expiration of rules
 - Turns any DNS block into a firewall block
 - SNI inspection to detect domain fronting and TLS connection abuse

# Configuration

dfirewall is configured entirely through environment variables and JSON configuration files for advanced features. There are no command-line arguments - all configuration is done via environment variables.

**üìñ For comprehensive configuration guidance, see:** [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)

### Quick Start Configuration
```bash
# Required
UPSTREAM=1.1.1.1:53          # upstream DNS resolver
REDIS=redis://127.0.0.1:6379 # Redis connection string

# Optional
PORT=53                      # listening port
WEB_UI_PORT=8080            # web interface port
```

## Advanced Upstream DNS Routing

dfirewall supports sophisticated upstream DNS resolver routing based on client IP addresses and domain patterns. This enables network segmentation, geographic routing, split-horizon DNS, and specialized DNS services per client or domain.

### Key Features
- **Per-client routing**: Route DNS queries from specific clients/networks to different upstream resolvers
- **Per-zone routing**: Route specific domains to different upstream resolvers  
- **Priority-based**: Client rules take precedence over zone rules
- **Flexible patterns**: Support for exact matches, CIDR notation, wildcards, and regex patterns
- **Fallback support**: Configurable default upstream when no rules match

**üìñ For comprehensive upstream routing configuration, see:** [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#upstream-configuration-upstream_config)
# Setup on Linux

dfirewall can be deployed as a network router with firewall capabilities.  The easiest platform to do this on is Linux thanks to ipset.

**üìñ For a quick-start demo setup on Linux see:** [docs/linux-setup.md](docs/linux-setup.md)

## Redis Key Expiration Monitoring (for non-Linux/non-ipset support)

If you're running dfirewall on non-Linux platforms or want to use custom firewall management, you can enable Redis key expiration monitoring:

```bash
# Set the EXPIRE_SCRIPT environment variable
EXPIRE_SCRIPT=/path/to/your/expire_script.sh

# Example using the provided generic expire script
EXPIRE_SCRIPT=./scripts/expire_generic.sh
```

When enabled, dfirewall will:
1. Monitor Redis keyspace notifications for expired keys
2. Execute your expire script when DNS TTLs + grace period expire
3. Pass the same environment variables as INVOKE_SCRIPT, plus `ACTION=EXPIRE`

**TTL Grace Period**: All DNS TTLs are extended with a configurable grace period (default 90 seconds) before firewall rules are removed. This prevents premature rule expiration and provides a buffer for DNS refresh cycles. Configure via `TTL_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS` environment variable.

**Redis Configuration Note**: Redis keyspace notifications must be enabled. dfirewall attempts to enable this automatically, but if it fails, run:
```bash
redis-cli CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events Ex
```

## Redis Security Configuration

dfirewall supports secure Redis connections with TLS encryption and authentication. Configure basic authentication or advanced TLS encryption with client certificates.

**üìñ For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/redis-security.md](docs/redis-security.md)

## Web UI for Rule Management

dfirewall includes a built-in web interface for viewing and managing firewall rules. Enable it by setting the `WEB_UI_PORT` environment variable:

```bash
# Enable web UI on port 8080
WEB_UI_PORT=8080
```

Once enabled, access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` (or your server's IP). The web UI provides:

### Main Dashboard
- **Real-time Statistics**: View total rules, active clients, unique domains, and IPs
- **Rule Listing**: Two view modes - grouped by client or traditional table view
- **Rule Management**: Delete individual rules manually
- **Client History**: View detailed DNS lookup history for specific clients
- **All Clients**: Browse all clients that have made DNS requests
- **Auto-refresh**: Interface updates every 30 seconds automatically

### Security Management (Tabbed Interface)
The Web UI now includes a dedicated **üõ°Ô∏è Security** section with organized tabs:

#### üö´ Blacklist Management Tab
- Add/remove IPs and domains from blacklists
- View current blacklist entries with removal options
- Real-time blacklist updates

#### ü§ñ Reputation & AI Analysis Tab  
- Check IP/domain reputation with threat intelligence providers
- AI-powered threat analysis using configured AI providers
- Interactive analysis results with detailed scoring and reasoning

### Additional Features
- **Settings Panel**: Configure auto-refresh intervals and view system status
- **SNI Inspection Monitoring**: View SNI connection statistics and active connections (when enabled)
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized button layout that fits on one line

## Per-Client Script Configuration

dfirewall supports per-client script configuration for different firewall policies based on client identity using CIDR, IP, and regex pattern matching.

**üìñ For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/per-client-scripts.md](docs/per-client-scripts.md)

## IP and Domain Blacklisting

dfirewall supports comprehensive IP and domain blacklisting using Redis and file-based approaches with pattern matching and Web UI management.

**üìñ For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/blacklist-configuration.md](docs/blacklist-configuration.md)

## IP and Domain Reputation Checking

dfirewall integrates with VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLVoid, and custom threat intelligence providers for real-time security analysis.

**üìñ For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/reputation-checking.md](docs/reputation-checking.md)

## AI-Powered Threat Detection

dfirewall integrates AI technology (OpenAI, Claude, local models) for domain analysis, traffic anomaly detection, and proactive threat hunting.

**üìñ For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/ai-threat-detection.md](docs/ai-threat-detection.md)

## SNI Inspection & Domain Fronting Detection

dfirewall includes advanced SNI (Server Name Indication) inspection to detect TLS connection abuse where clients resolve one domain via DNS but connect with a different SNI header. This helps detect domain fronting attacks, DNS cache poisoning, and certificate abuse.

### Key Features

- **TLS Connection Interception**: Intercepts TLS connections on configurable proxy ports
- **SNI Header Validation**: Compares DNS-requested domains with actual TLS SNI headers
- **Domain Fronting Detection**: Identifies clients attempting to abuse legitimate domain firewall rules
- **Per-Client/Domain Policies**: Flexible configuration for selective SNI inspection
- **Real-time Statistics**: Comprehensive monitoring with connection tracking and mismatch detection
- **Security Integration**: Works alongside existing blacklisting, reputation checking, and AI analysis

### Quick Start

```bash
# Enable SNI inspection
SNI_INSPECTION_CONFIG=/path/to/sni-inspection-config.json
```

**üìñ For detailed configuration and deployment, see:** [docs/sni-inspection.md](docs/sni-inspection.md)

## Log Collection and Analysis

dfirewall can collect and analyze logs from remote and local sources to extract IP addresses and domains for firewall rule creation. This feature enables proactive security by monitoring various log sources and automatically adding discovered threats to the firewall.

### Key Features

- **Remote Log Collection**: SSH-based log collection from remote servers
- **Local File Monitoring**: Monitor local log files for changes
- **Regex Pattern Matching**: Extract IPs and domains using configurable regex patterns
- **Real-time Processing**: Process log entries as they appear
- **Security Pipeline Integration**: Extracted IPs/domains go through blacklist, reputation, AI, and custom script validation
- **Automatic Firewall Rules**: Valid threats automatically added to firewall rules

### Quick Start

```bash
# Enable log collection
LOG_COLLECTOR_CONFIG=/path/to/log-collector-config.json
```

**üìñ For detailed configuration, see:** [docs/log-collection.md](docs/log-collection.md)
